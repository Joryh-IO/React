WHat is JSX?
    Java Script xml is a sytax extention to JavaScript which uses babel as its 
    compiler and thus making it easier to write code.

Superpowers of JSX  
    - combines html and javascript
    - Dynamic content: by using {} we can write JS in JSX and JSx in JS in JSX
    - we can logically choose what to render as we make out own componenets and tags
    - JSX automatically skips strings and props to prevent cross-side scripting
    - writing code is faster and easy to read

Types of scripts  
    Module:This type lets the js know that it can import and export modules and deal with modules
    CommonJS: this type lets the js know that its a normal javaScript file.
